>>>>>>>>>>  Proposed Parser module changes  <<<<<<<<<<<<

- Old parser classes had redundancies and were not made for a wider scope of uses.
- CSV, XML, and JSON wrappers specifically were made to add read in data to Metadata only.
- Parser class acted like a Parser factory/driver...

- New parser module introduces inheritance where new Parser class is abstract, acting as a
  parent class to all the Parsers.
- Read in data is not added to metadata within the parser method, but put in a separate method
  if that is what the user desires to do with the data.
- Added constructors model typical FileReader structures for easier-ish use
- Parser Factory included which returns the appropriate parser depending on the supplied file
    - custom Exception: IncompatibleFileTypeException
